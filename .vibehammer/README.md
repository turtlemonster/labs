# VibeHammer Integration

This folder contains scripts that enable VibeHammer's interactive preview features.

## What it does
- Detects text selection in your preview
- Enables "Send to Chat" feature for AI-assisted editing
- Communicates with VibeHammer's parent window

## Setup Instructions

To enable interactive mode, add this script tag to your HTML file(s) before the closing `</head>` tag:

```html
<script src="/.vibehammer/injector.js" defer></script>
```

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Site</title>
  <!-- Add this line -->
  <script src="/.vibehammer/injector.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your content -->
</body>
</html>
```

## How to remove
You can disable interactive mode from the VibeHammer preview interface, or manually delete this `.vibehammer` folder and remove the script tag from your HTML files.
