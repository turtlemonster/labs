                <h3>Will my dog's feelings get hurt?</h3>
                <p>Possibly. But at least they'll be in a safe space where everyone understands that their feelings are valid and also slightly ridiculous.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if my dog is TOO needy?</h3>
                <p>There's no such thing! That's like saying there's too much ice cream. We celebrate the chaos.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you offer virtual therapy?</h3>
                <p>We tried Zoom sessions, but dogs kept barking at themselves in the screen, which defeated the purpose. Now we're considering it for humans with anxiety about their dogs having Zoom anxiety.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's included in a typical day?</h3>
                <p>Breakfast crisis management, morning feelings circle, philosophical walks, snack existentialism, afternoon cuddles, evening emotions debriefing, and the 6pm treat countdown anxiety we all share.</p>
